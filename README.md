This addon provides some utilities and services that make it easier
to control timing in your Ember applications.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-stopwatch
```

## Demo

[Demo](https://tzellman.github.io/ember-stopwatch/)

## Usage

-   [Stopwatch](#stopwatch)
-   [Timer](#timer)
-   [Clock](#clock)

### Stopwatch

A `Stopwatch` is a utility that allows you to be notified when `ticks` occur,
making it easy for you to asynchronously take action on time-based boundaries.

The `Stopwatch` uses `@tracked` properties so your application
can react to changes in time, based on the tick interval.

The `stop` and `reset` methods allow you to either stop on the next tick interval,
or forcefully (i.e. immediately).

#### As a utility

This is the primary use-case, and allows you to create multiple stopwatches anywhere
in your application.

```javascript
import Stopwatch from "ember-stopwatch/utils/stopwatch";

// ...
let stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
stopwatch.start();
stopwatch.stop();
stopwatch.reset();
stopwatch.on("tick", someHandler);
// ...
```

```handlebars
    {{this.stopwatch.elapsedMillis}}
    {{this.stopwatch.numTicks}}
```

#### As a Service

A `stopwatch` service can be used that is shared globally in your application.

```javascript
export default class extends Component {
    @service stopwatch;
    @action
    start() {
        this.stopwatch.start();
    }
    @action
    stop() {
        this.stopwatch.stop();
    }
}
```

### Timer

A `Timer` is a utility that extends the `Stopwatch` behavior described above,
except that the use-case is to handle "countdown" eventing. This enables your
application to react to a `timeout` event.

Additionally, the `Timer` can be paused and restarted and contains reactful state
properties (e.g. `remainingMillis` and `isExpired`).

```javascript
import Timer from "ember-stopwatch/utils/timer";

// ...
let timer = new Timer(60000);
timer.on("expired", this, expirationHandler);
timer.start();
// ...

expirationHandler(){
    console.log('Time is up!');
}
```

```handlebars
    {{this.timer.remainingMillis}}
    {{this.timer.isExpired}}
```

### Clock

#### As a utility

A `Clock` is a utility that tracks time ticks for the current system time.

A `Clock` triggers events on time ticks, including `second`, `minute`, `hour`, and `day`.
A `Clock` also provides reactful `time`, `date`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, and `day` properties.

```javascript
import Clock from "ember-stopwatch/utils/clock";

// ...
let clock = new Clock();
clock.on("second", myHandler.bind(this, "second"));
clock.on("minute", myHandler.bind(this, "minute"));
clock.start();
// ...

myHandler(type){
    console.log(`${type} ticked`);
}
```

```handlebars
    {{this.clock.time}}
```

#### As a Service

A `clock` service automatically creates and starts a single instance of the `Clock` utility and is a proxy for properties and methods of a clock instance.
A `clock` service also has `@tracked` versions of the clock properties `second`, `minute`, `hour`, and `day` that can be used by the `@computed` macro to react to.

```javascript
export default class extends Component {
    @service clock;
}
```

```handlebars
    {{moment-format this.clock.time}}
```

```javascript
export default class extends Component {
    @service clock;

    @computed("clock.minute")
    get timeByTheMinute() {
        return new Date().getTime();
    }

    @computed("clock.hour")
    get timeByTheHour() {
        return new Date().getTime();
    }

    @computed("clock.day")
    get timeByTheDay() {
        return new Date().getTime();
    }
}
```

```handlebars
    Refreshes every second: {{moment-format this.clock.time}}
    Refreshes every minute: {{moment-format this.timeByTheMinute}}
    Refreshes every hour: {{moment-format this.timeByTheHour}}
    Refreshes every day: {{moment-format this.timeByTheDay}}
```
